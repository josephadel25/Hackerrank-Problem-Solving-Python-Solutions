Difficulty: Easy  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
Now that you've got a taste of working with sets in Python, let's use them in a real-world application.

Your task is to compute the average of the distinct heights of a group of plants.

Function Description:
Complete the function average in the editor below.

average has the following parameter:
- int array: an array of integers representing plant heights

Returns:
- float: the average of the unique heights, rounded to 3 decimal places

Input Format:
- The first line contains the integer N, the total number of plants.
- The second line contains the N space-separated heights of the plants.

Constraints:
- 0 < N <= 100

Output Format:
- Output the average height value on a single line, rounded to 3 decimal places.

Sample Input:
10  
161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174

Sample Output:
169.375

Explanation:
- The set of unique heights is {154, 161, 167, 170, 171, 174, 176, 182}
- Their sum is 1355
- The number of unique heights is 8
- Average = 1355 / 8 = 169.375
