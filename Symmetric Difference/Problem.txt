Problem Name: Symmetric Difference

Difficulty: Easy  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
Given two sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order.

The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer M, the number of elements in set A.
- The second line contains M space-separated integers.
- The third line contains an integer N, the number of elements in set B.
- The fourth line contains N space-separated integers.

Constraints:
- 0 < M, N < 100

Output Format:
Print the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, each on a new line.

Sample Input:
4  
2 4 5 9  
4  
2 4 11 12

Sample Output:
5  
9  
11  
12

Explanation:
Set A = {2, 4, 5, 9}  
Set B = {2, 4, 11, 12}  
Symmetric Difference = {5, 9, 11, 12}  
Sorted order: 5, 9, 11, 12
