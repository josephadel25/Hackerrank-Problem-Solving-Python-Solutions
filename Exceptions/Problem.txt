Problem Name: Exceptions

Difficulty: Easy  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
You are given two values a and b.  
Perform integer division and print a // b.

If either a or b is not an integer, or if b is zero, print the appropriate error message:
- For ZeroDivisionError: print "Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero"
- For ValueError (non-integer input): print "Error Code: <exception message>"

Input Format:
- The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
- The next T lines each contain two values a and b.

Constraints:
- 0 < T < 10

Output Format:
Print the result of the integer division or the error message.

Sample Input:
3  
1 0  
2 $  
3 1

Sample Output:
Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero  
Error Code: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '$'  
3

Explanation:
- First case fails because division by zero is not allowed.
- Second case fails because '$' is not a valid integer.
- Third case runs successfully and prints 3.
