# HackerRank Problem Solving – Python Solutions 🐍

This repository contains my personal solutions to various Python programming problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), covering beginner to intermediate levels.

Each problem includes:
- ✅ Problem name
- 📄 Problem description (copied from HackerRank)
- 💡 Python solution

---

## 📁 Structure

Solutions are organized by problem title. Each Python file corresponds to a single HackerRank challenge.

Example:
Say "Hello, World!" With Python/
├── description.txt
└── solution.py

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- 🧮 Basic Math & Operators  
- 🔁 Loops & Conditionals  
- 🧵 Strings & Formatting  
- 📚 Sets & Collections  
- 🔢 itertools, divmod, pow  
- 🧮 Built-in Functions & Data Types  
- 📦 Modules like `collections`, `itertools`

## 📈 Goal

This project is part of my ongoing journey to strengthen Python programming fundamentals and prepare for coding interviews.

Feel free to use these for learning or revising — but I encourage you to **try solving the problems yourself first**!
