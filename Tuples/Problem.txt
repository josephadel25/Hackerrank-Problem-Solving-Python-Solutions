Problem Name: Tuples

Difficulty: Easy  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
Given an integer, n, and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, t, of those n integers.  
Then compute and print the result of hash(t).

Note:  
The hash() function returns the hash value of an object (if it has one).  
Hash values are integers used to quickly compare dictionary keys while looking up a dictionary.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in the tuple.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 20
- Integers will be in the range: 0 <= integer <= 100

Output Format:
Print the hash value of the tuple.

Sample Input:
2  
1 2

Sample Output:
3713081631934410656

Explanation:
The tuple is (1, 2).  
The hash of the tuple is computed and printed using Python's built-in hash() function.
