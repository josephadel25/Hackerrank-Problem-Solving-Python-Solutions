Problem Name: Write a function

Difficulty: Medium  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return True; otherwise, return False.

To determine whether a year is a leap year, use the following rules:

- The year is a leap year if the following conditions are satisfied:
    - The year is divisible by 4
    - If the year is divisible by 100, then it must also be divisible by 400

This means that 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not.

Input Format:
Read an integer year from the standard input.

Constraints:
1900 <= year <= 10^5

Output Format:
Your function must return a boolean value (True/False). The output will be handled by the provided code stub.

Sample Input:
1990

Sample Output:
False

Explanation:
1990 is not divisible by 4. Hence, it is not a leap year.
