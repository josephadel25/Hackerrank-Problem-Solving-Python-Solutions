Problem Name: collections.deque()

Difficulty: Easy  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
A deque is a double-ended queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends.

Your task is to perform N operations on an empty deque d.

Operations include:
- append x
- appendleft x
- pop
- popleft

Function Description:
Use the `collections.deque` data structure to efficiently perform append and pop operations from both ends.

Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of operations.
- The next N lines contain the operations.

Constraints:
- 1 <= N <= 100

Output Format:
Print the space-separated elements of the deque after performing all operations.

Sample Input:
6  
append 1  
append 2  
appendleft 3  
pop  
popleft  
append 4

Sample Output:
2 4

Explanation:
After performing the given operations step by step:
- append 1 → [1]
- append 2 → [1, 2]
- appendleft 3 → [3, 1, 2]
- pop → [3, 1]
- popleft → [1]
- append 4 → [1, 4]
Final output: 1 4
