Difficulty: Easy  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
You have a non-empty set s, and you have to execute N commands given in the form of:
- pop
- remove x
- discard x

You must perform these operations on the set and print the sum of the remaining elements.

Function Descriptions:
- pop(): removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises KeyError if the set is empty.
- remove(x): removes x from the set. Raises KeyError if x is not present.
- discard(x): removes x from the set if it is present. Does nothing if x is not present.

Input Format:
- The first line contains integer n, the number of elements in the set.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers (the initial elements of the set).
- The third line contains integer N, the number of commands.
- The next N lines contain the commands.

Constraints:
- 0 < n < 20  
- 0 < N < 20

Output Format:
Print the sum of the remaining elements in the set on a single line.

Sample Input:
9  
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
10  
pop  
remove 9  
discard 9

remove 7  
pop  
discard 6  
remove 5
