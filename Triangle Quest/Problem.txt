Problem Name: Triangle Quest

Difficulty: Medium  
Max Score: 20

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer N.  
For each number i from 1 to N - 1, print a number composed of i repetitions of the digit i, without using string operations.

That is, for each i (1 <= i < N), print:
111...1 (i times)

But using only math operations.

Hint:
You can use the following expression:
((10 ** i) - 1) // 9 gives you a number with i digits, all 1s.

So, i * ((10 ** i - 1) // 9) gives you i repeated i times.

Input Format:
A single line containing integer N.

Constraints:
- 1 < N < 10

Output Format:
Print the pattern as described.

Sample Input:
5

Sample Output:
