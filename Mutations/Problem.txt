Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).

Let's try to understand this with an example:
You are given a string, and you need to replace a character at a specific index with a new character.

Function Description:
Complete the mutate_string function in the editor below.

mutate_string has the following parameters:
- string string: the original string
- int position: the index to insert the character at
- string character: the character to insert

Returns:
- string: the string after mutation

Input Format:
The first line contains a string, s.  
The second line contains an integer i, the index location.  
The third line contains a single character c.

Constraints:
- 0 <= i < len(s)
- The string will only contain printable ASCII characters.

Output Format:
Print the mutated string.

Sample Input:
abracadabra  
5  
k

Sample Output:
abrackdabra
