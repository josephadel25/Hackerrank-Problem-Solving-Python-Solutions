Problem Statement:
Raghu is a shoe shop owner. His shop has X number of shoes.  
He has a list containing the size of each shoe he has in his shop.  
There are N number of customers who are willing to pay x amount of money only if they get the shoe of their desired size.

Your task is to compute how much money Raghu earned.

Input Format:
- The first line contains X, the number of shoes.  
- The second line contains the space-separated list of shoe sizes in the shop.  
- The third line contains N, the number of customers.  
- The next N lines contain the space-separated values of shoe size desired by the customer and x, the price he is willing to pay.

Constraints:
- 0 < X < 10^3  
- 0 < N <= 10^3  
- 0 < shoe size < 100  
- 0 < x <= 100

Output Format:
Print the total money earned by Raghu.

Sample Input:
10  
2 3 4 5 6 8 7 6 5 18  
6  
6 30  
6 40  
6 50  
6 60  
6 70  
6 80

Sample Output:
200

Explanation:
- Customer 1 gets shoe size 6 for $30. Remaining: one size 6 left.  
- Customer 2 gets shoe size 6 for $40. No size 6 left.  
- Customers 3â€“6 want size 6, but it's out of stock.  
- Total earned = 30 + 40 = 70

(Note: this sample output in the problem actually uses different shoe sizes. The above explanation illustrates the logic.)
