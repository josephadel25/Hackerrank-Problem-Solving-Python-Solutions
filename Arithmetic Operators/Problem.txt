2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (a - b).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

Input Format:
The first line contains the first integer, a.  
The second line contains the second integer, b.

Constraints:
1 <= a <= 10^10  
1 <= b <= 10^10

Output Format:
Print the three results on separate lines:
- The sum (a + b)
- The difference (a - b)
- The product (a * b)

3  
2

Sample Output:
5  
1  
6
