Problem Name: itertools.product()

Difficulty: Easy  
Max Score: 10

Problem Statement:
You are given a two lists A and B.  
Your task is to compute their Cartesian product A × B.

Example:  
A = [1, 2]  
B = [3, 4]  
A × B = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]

Note: The result should be printed in lexicographic increasing order.

Input Format:
- The first line contains the space-separated elements of list A.
- The second line contains the space-separated elements of list B.

Constraints:
- Each list contains at most 30 elements.
- Elements are integers between 0 and 10.

Output Format:
- Output the space-separated tuples of the Cartesian product.

Sample Input:
1 2  
3 4

Sample Output:
(1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)

Explanation:
The Cartesian product is computed using itertools.product(), and printed in order.
